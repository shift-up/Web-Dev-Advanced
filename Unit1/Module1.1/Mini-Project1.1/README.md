### Mini Project Instructions

1. Open the [project page on OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/3505461-breakdown-and-integrate-a-mockup/6785371-get-some-practice-integrating-a-mockup-in-html-and-css)

2. The project encourages you to identify your client before you begin. What do they do? Where are they based? Please create a markdown file (.md) in your project folder and include a few brief notes about your client.

3. Next, you'll visit one of the sites containing visual mockups. Find one that fits the overall feel and needs of your client.
    * Don't worry about using Photoshop or downloading a PSD file.
    * Do consider visiting the demo site for your chosen theme, if available, and using your browser's inspector tools to check the dimensions of the major elements on the page.

4. Using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/), do your best to recreate the layout, look, and feel of the mockup. 
    * Change elements as needed to reflect the branding / offering of your client.
    * Note: if you have trouble with Bootstrap, please see the [Starter Template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template) as an example of adding the Bootstrap CSS and JS to your page. Your project should not require any JavaScript files, but Bootstrap requires a  &lt;link&gt; tag and a few  &lt;script&gt; tags in your HTML file.

5. Create a new branch and then new Pull Request and assign it to your coach for review.
