### Mini Project Instructions

1. Open the [project page on OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/6031801-implement-a-relational-database-with-sql/6774636-get-some-practice-building-an-employee-database). We recommend using MySQL or Postgres as your database as these systems are popular for web servers and completely free.

1. Create a new text file called `queries.txt` 

1. As you work through the assignment to build your database, copy each query you execute (after verifying it works correctly) in the `queries.txt`. 

1. After adding your "junk" data, write SELECT queries to output the data within each table. Copy and paste the output of each SELECT query into `queries.txt`.

1. Put the the `queries.txt` file in the `Unit2/Module2.2/Mini-Project2.2a/` directory, and submit it for coach review as a Pull Request.
