### OVERVIEW & GOALS

This project is a follow-on to the Unit1 Project. In this project you will be integrating an SQL database into the full-stack app you built for the Unit 1 project. You will also practice  the opportunity to further develop the data side of your application.


### SPECIFICATIONS

* Your application must use an SQL-based database system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. This database will replace Mongo, but we recommend doing this incrementally, so you don't have to fully remove Mongo until you get the SQL database and queries working.
* Replace each Mongo query with a query to your SQL-based database. You can either use straight SQL or a library such as [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/).
* You must have at least 3 tables in your database
* Ensure each table has a primary key
* At least one table should have a foreign key constraint to ensure data integrity
* Add an index to at least one table to improve performance
* Add functionality to your application which makes an SQL query that involves a `JOIN` operation
* Implement a search function in your app that makes use of the `LIKE` command (you may have to look up how to use `LIKE` in SQL)
