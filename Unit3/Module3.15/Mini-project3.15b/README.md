### Welcome to Mini Project 3.15a
 
When we take a look at your Tic-Tac-Toe application as is, everything is currently in a single file. This doesn't seem too bad at the moment, but consider what might happen if you continued to add new features to your game. 

For this project, your job is to separate your application into multiple files. Generally, every component in a React project will reside in its own file. This is part of where the awesome power of React comes from-- the ability to reduce complex applications into small, reusable components that can be easily maintained and shared.

### Mini Project Instructions

1. Find and separate at least one reusable component within your current application. Export and import it correctly(If you're unsure how to do this, search online for "React import and export components").

2. Separate any utilites in your main file into their own utility files, and export and import them appropriately. Research what a typical utility file is and how they can be beneficial.

3. Create a new branch and then new Pull Request and assign it to your coach for review.
