# Mini Project 3.15b: Create a Component Hierarchy

### OVERVIEW & GOALS
 
When we take a look at your Tic-Tac-Toe application as is  - everything is currently in a single file. You should be able to take different components from this file and seperate them into their own individual files. By the end of this project you should have an understanding of what Resuable components are, and how you could possibly apply them to your Tic-Tac-Toe project. 

### SPECIFICATIONS

* Find and separate at least one reusable component from your current application - Export and Import it correctly. Research these concepts on your own.

* Separate any utilites in your main file into its own separate uitlity file, export and import them appropriately. Research what a typical utility file is and why they can be beneficial.
