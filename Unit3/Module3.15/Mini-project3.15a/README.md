# Mini Project 3.15a: Using Local Storage

### OVERVIEW & GOALS
 
You've built yourself an small Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. Now, how can we persist our state using local storage ? Time to figure it out ! By the end of this project you should be able to close your browser, or do a hard refresh and still see the same state you left your Tic-Tac-Toe game in. This will require you to resaerch on your own implementing local storage in a react app.

Why is this important ? 
    Diving into local storage and using it with React's state, as well as learning how to clear it, should help your understanding of React's state management even more. 

### SPECIFICATIONS

* Mid-game, when you hit refresh or close your window - navigating back to your app you will see your Tic-Tac-Toe board in the same state you left it

* You've added a button that gives the user to start a game over (clear their Tic-Tac-Toe board a.k.a reset your state)
