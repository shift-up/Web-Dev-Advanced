### Welcome to Mini Project 3.3

This project gives you practice implementing measures to ensure security of an ExpressJS application.

### Mini Project Instructions

1. For this assignment you should find any ExpressJS code you've written so far. For example, you could use the ExpressJS application you built for Unit 1 Project. 

1. Based on your knowledge of OWASP, you should do an audit of your code. Add comments into the code that notes places where there may be a potential OWASP vulnerability, be sure to include the name of the vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection). 

1. Next, you should make a code change that somehow improves the security of your ExpressJS application. You can review [a list of tips specific to ExpressJS here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/express-js-security-tips/)).

1. Put your vulnerability comments and code changes into a new Pull Request to submit it for coach review.
